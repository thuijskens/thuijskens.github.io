title: About me
---

I am a Principal Data Scientist at [QuantumBlack](http://www.quantumblack.com), and I work and live in London. I'm using this site to occasionally share some of my personal insights and opinions about the world of data science.

I graduated with distinction from the University of Oxford with a masters degree in statistics. Before moving to the fields of statistics and data science, I was mainly interested in stochastic calculus, numerical methods and financial mathematics. I have a BSc degree in Applied Mathematics with distinction from Delft University of Technology, in which I focused heavily on these subjects.

If you want to get in touch with me, you can contact me by [email](mailto:thomas_huijskens@hotmail.com), or through my [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/thomashuijskens) page. I'm always happy to connect with other people that share my interests.
